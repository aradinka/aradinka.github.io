E.g., navigation apps and recomendation engines.\n\nML Classifiec into:\n1. Supervised\n2. Unsupervised\n3. Reinforcement Learning\n\n\u003e Read more: [What is the difference between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning?](difference-between-supervised-unsupervised-reinforcement-learning.md)\n\n## Data Science\n\nData science has many tools, techniques and algorithms called from these fields to handle big data. The goal of data science, somewhat similar to machine learning, is to make accurate predictions and to automate and perform transactions in real-time, such as purchasing internet traffic or automatically generating content.\n\nData science relies less on math and coding and more on data and building new systems to process the data. Relying on the fields of data integration, distributed architechture, automated machine learning, data visualization, data engineering and automated data-driven decisions. Data science can cover an entire spectrum of data pprocessing, not only the algorithms or statistics related to data.\n\n## Deep Learning\n\nDeep learning is a technique for implementing ML. ML provides the desired output from a given input, but DL (Deep Learning) reads the input and applies it to another data. \n\nIn ML, we can easily classify the flower based upon the features. Suppose you want a machine to look at an image and determine what it represents to human eye, wherer a face, flower, landscape, truck, building, etc. ML is not sufficient for this task because machine learning can only produce an output from a data set - whether according to a known algorithm or based on the inherent structure of the data. You might be able to use machine learning to determine to use ML to determine whether an image was of an \"X\" - a flower, say - and it would learn and get more accurate. But that output is binary (yes/no) and is dependent on the algorithm, not the data.\n\nIn the image recognition case, the outcome is not binary and not dependent on the algorithm. The neural network perform micro calculations with computational on many layers. Neural networks also support weighting data for confidence. These results in  a probabilistic system, vs. deterministics, and can handle tasks that we think of as requiring more \"human-like\" judgement.Z\n\n\u003e Source: [iNeuronai](https://github.com/iNeuronai/interview-question-data-science-)","lastmodified":"2022-11-07T08:01:06.283831553Z","tags":null},"/difference-between-supervised-unsupervised-reinforcement-learning":{"title":"What is the difference between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning?","content":"\n## Supervised Learning\n\nIn a supervised learning model, the algorithm learns on **a labeled dataset**, to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new data.

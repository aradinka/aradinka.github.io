Dear hiring manager,

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for Data Scientist position at tiket.com. I am confident in my ability to perform data science related task at tiket.com due to my internship experience and my education background.

During my internship at technical AI team at Telkom Indonesia, I had an extensive range of tasks including paper research, implement recent paper by reproducing the GitHub repo in our server, train language model with multiple GPU, built speaker diarization capability, produced custom 20GB+ audio conversation dataset and contributed to write paper. As a Data Scientist, I was required to have a good communication skill, good python skill, and undestanding the algorithms. During my one-year internship at Telkom Indonesia, I applied these skills daily.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to review my application.

Sincerely,

Azka Radinka

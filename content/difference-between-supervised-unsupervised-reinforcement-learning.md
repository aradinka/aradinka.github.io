## Supervised Learning

In a supervised learning model, the algorithm learns on **a labeled dataset**, to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new data. Ex:
- Regression
- Classification

## Unsupervised Learning

An unsupervised learning model in contrast provides unlabelled data that the algorithm tries to make sense of by extracting features, co-occurrence and underlying patterns on its own. Ex:
- Clustering
- Anomaly detection
- Associations
- Autoencoders

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is less supervised and depends on the learning agent in determining the output solutions by arriving at different possible ways to achieve the best possible solution.

## Significance level (alpha)

- Denoted as alpha or $\alpha$
- The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true
- Generally, we use the significance value of 0.05


## P-value

- The probability that the difference between two values is just because random chance
- P-value is evidance againts the null hypothesis
- The smaller p-value stronger the chances to reject the $H_0$
- For the significance level of 0.05, if the pvalue is lesser than it, hence we can reject the null hypothesis

## Confidence Interval

- The confidence interval is an observed range in which a given percentage of test outcomes fall
- Generally, we take a 95% confidence interval

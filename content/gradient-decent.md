- It's an iterative ML optimization algorithm
- It reduce the cost function
- It help models to make accurate predictions

Gradient indicates the **direction** of increase
- As we want to find the minimum points in the valley, we need to go in the opposite direction of the gradient.

Types of gradient descents:
- Batch / vanilla gradient descent
- [[stochastic-gradient-descent]]

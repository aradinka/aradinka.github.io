# PARA Methods

P.A.R.A. stands for **Projects — Areas — Resources — Archives**, the four top-level categories that encompass every type of information you might encounter in your work and life.

- Projects: a series of tasks linked to a goal
- Area: a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time
- Resource: a topic or theme of ongoing interest
- Archive: inactive items from the other three categories

example tags:
- project-project_name
- area-ds

## What is hypothesis?

> A hypothesis is a concept that is not yet verified, but if true would explain certain facts or phenomena

## What is hypothesis testing?

It is an **educated guess** about something in the world around you. It should be **testable**, either by experiment or observation.

In hypothesis testing, we have to make two hypotheses i.e Null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis

### Null Hypothesis

The null hypothesis is the one that states that sample observations result purely from change.

### Alternative Hypothesis

The alternative hypothesis challenges the null hypothesis and is basically **a hypothesis that the researcher believes to be true**.

## Two types of error in hypothesis testing

### Type I error

> We reject the null hypothesis when it is true

That is we accept the variant B when it is not performing better than A

### Type II error

> We failed to reject the null hypothesis when it is false

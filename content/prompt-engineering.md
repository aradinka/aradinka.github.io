# Five Principles of Prompting

It's getting increasingly impossible to keep up with AI:

- published papers on arXiv growing exponentially
- open source AI projects (stable diffusion, AgentGPT) are the fastest growing projects on GitHub
- Midjourney discord server has 15M members

> AI results are non-deterministic

> The doomer narrative that AI will take all our jobs is likely overblown, the productivity boost from working with AI is real

> It’s a new form of programming, where the skill is not in writing algorithms or training your own AI models, but “curating prompts to make the meta learner get the task it’s supposed to be doing”

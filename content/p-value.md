What is p-value?
- p-value is a statistical measurement used to validate a hypothesis againts observed data

What does the p-value measures?
- p-value measure the probability of obtaining the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true

How to calculate p-value?
1. Find out the test statistic $z$ 
	- $z = \frac{\hat p - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}$
	- where:
	  $\hat p$ = sample proportion
	  $p_0$ = assumed population proportion in the null hypothesis
	  $n$ = sample size 
2. Look at the z-table to find the corresponding level of p from the z value obtained

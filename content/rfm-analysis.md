## What is RFM?

> Are all my customers similar?

> What differentiated them from each other?

> Who is the most likely customer?

> Who are my best customers?

> Which customer has the potential to buy more?

> Which customer has been churned out / has lapsed?

> Which customer can be converted by creating value through promotions?

> Which customer is likely to be loyal in the near future?

> What brand means the existing customers?

Summary:
- Built on historical transactions between user and the business

Pareto principle to RFM:
-  80% of total results are driven by the top 20% causes
- In marketing: 80% of your total sales are likely to come from your top 20% of customers


Why customer segmentation is highly critical
- Regular customers will always be high contributors to business monetary value, and hence that customer 


All R, F, M criteria can be graded on a scale of 1 to 5. It is also critical to specify an appropriate range for each grade, in order to create a customer group with a similar or a particular behavior

## Advantages


Why is RFM analysis is better than traditional segmentation model?

> The RFM analysis **built on transactions between the customer and the business**, to create a robust data-backend method based on hard numbers 

This customer data is graded, analyzed, and then segmented in order to engage customers as distinct groups. 

This model helps businesses effectively **analyze the past buying behavior of each customer**, to predict and shape future customer behavior

Traditional methods:
- Traditional methods of customer segmentation, used by market research companies before the advent of data analytics, used variables like **demographic and psychographic factors** to group their customers
- A sample could be incorrect, due to many reasons like an insufficient number of consumers, incorrect gender balance, varying psychigraphic factors, etc
- Traditional research involved factors like psychographics, which could be interpreted subjectively

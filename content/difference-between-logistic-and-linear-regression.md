Linear and Logistic regression are the most basic form of regression which are commonly used. 

| Linear                                                                                  | Logistic                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| dependent variable is continuous                                                        | dependent variable is binary                        |
| requires to establish the linear relationship among dependent and independent variables | not necessary for logistic regression               |
| independent variable can be correlated with each other                                  | the variable must not be correlated with each other |
